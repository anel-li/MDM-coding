    "## Starting Out: Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a language designed for a very specific purpose: to interact with relational databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database**: A database is a structured collection of data. There are various different ways of structuring the database, and there may or may not be information about the relationship between entities in the database.\n",
    "- **Query**: A query is a request for data from the database. \n",
    "- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: A DBMS is a system of storing and managing databases, including querying the database.\n",
    "- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**: In an RDBMS, data records are stored in *tables*, each of which has a predefined set of *columns*, the pieces of information captured for each record in a table, and *rows* in the table, where each row has a place to store a value for every column in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables, including their columns, column types and relationships with other tables, are defined in a database **schema**. Many times, tables will contain a **primary key**, one or more columns that uniquely define a row. You can think of the primary key as a kind of ID, in which each row is given a unique ID. Tables can also contain  **foreign keys**, which are column(s) that comprise the primary key in another table and, thus, provides a way of matching between multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we'll use data stored using the PostgreSQL RDBMS. In practice, there are many others that you could use, each with its own unique characteristics, but the basic principles of relational data will remain the same.\n",
    "\n"

    "## <span style=\"color:green\">Writing a Basic Query </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyze the data in a database, we need to query it, or request specific information about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some basics. We'll start by retrieving all columns from the California Workplace Area Characteristic (`ca_wac_2015`) table. Try running the following query in pgAdmin:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM lodes.ca_wac_2015 LIMIT 10;\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see 10 rows of the `ca_wac_2015` dataset. Let's go over the basics of this SQL command.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SELECT:** We start out with the `SELECT` statement. The `SELECT` statement specifies which variables (columns) you want. \n",
    "    - Here, we used `SELECT *`. The \"`*`\" just says that we want all the variables. \n",
    "    - If we wanted a few columns, we would use the column names separated by commas instead of \"`*`\" (for example, `w_geocode, createdate`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FROM:** Now, let's look at the next part of the query, \"`FROM lodes.ca_wac_2015`\". The data that we want is in the `ca_wac_2015` table in the `lodes` schema. This part of the query specifies the schema, `lodes`, and the table, `ca_wac_2015`, from which we want to retrieve the data, with a \"`.`\" between the two. Most of your queries will begin in this fashion, describing which columns you want, from which table, making sure to include schema information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LIMIT:** We typically include a `LIMIT` statement at the end of our query so that we don't get overloaded with rows being output. Here, `LIMIT 10` means that we just want the first ten rows. Many times, the `LIMIT` that you want will be higher than 10 -- you might generally prefer to use 1000 or so. Having a `LIMIT` for all queries is highly recommended even if you know only a few rows will be shown, since it acts as a safety precaution against (for example) displaying millions of rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we've put everything in one line, but that's not necessary. We could have split the code up into multiple lines, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT * \n",
    "    FROM lodes.ca_wac_2015\n",
    "    LIMIT 10;\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the same output as our original query. Generally, once queries start getting longer, breaking up the code into multiple lines can be very helpful in organizing your code and making it easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along those lines, note that we used a semi-colon at the end of the query to mark the end of the query. That isn't absolutely necessary when using PostgreSQL, but it does help mark the end of a query and is required in other applications of SQL, so it's good practice to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Side note about capitalization\n",
    "If you notice, we've been using all caps for SQL commands and all lowercase for data table and schema names. This is simply a convention, as SQL is not case sensitive. For example, we could have run \"`select * from lodes.ca_wac_2015 limit 10;`\" and it would have given us the exact same output as the first query. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This does mean you need to be careful when using column names. If your column name has capital letters in it, you need use double quotes (e.g. `\"C000\"`) to preserve the capitalization. For this reason, you might find that using all lowercase letters in column names is preferable, which is what we've done here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the following query. What do you think it will do?\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT w_geocode, createdate \n",
    "    FROM lodes.ca_wac_2015\n",
    "    LIMIT 100;\n",
    "\n",
    "We've changed the original query by using \"`w_geocode, createdate`\" instead of \"`*`\", so we'll only get the values from two columns, `w_geocode` and `createdate`. In addition, we've changed the value after `LIMIT` to be 100 instead of 10, so we'll get the first 100 rows instead of the first 10 rows."

    "We've created a variable that indicates whether the census block had over 100 jobs or not. What if we wanted to know how many blocks had over 100 jobs and how many didn't? We can now use the `GROUP BY` statement. \n",

    "    SELECT over100, COUNT(over100) \n",

    "\n",
    "The `ORDER BY` statement orders the rows that it displays according to whatever you put after it. In this case, we chose the count of `over100`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using GROUP BY with Multiple Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next few queries, let's try using a different table. The `ca_xwalk` table in the same `lodes` schema contains information about each of the census blocks in California. We can use this to, for example, look at aggregation by CBSA (metropolitan/micropolitan area) name and by county name.\n",

In other cases in which we don't have complete nesting, we would be able to see all possible combinations that exist in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, notice that we used `DESC` after `ORDER BY`. This orders in descending order instead of ascending order, so that we can see the areas with the most census blocks at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Statements After Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to display only certain counts. We can use `HAVING` to do this.\n",

    "    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC\n",
    "    LIMIT 1000;\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will only display the counts for which the count of `cbsaname` is greater than 20000. Note that this is different from using `WHERE`, since the conditional statement comes after the `GROUP BY` statement. Basically, `HAVING` gives us a way of using the same types of conditional statements after we do our aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Different Aggregation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we wanted to find the sum within each group, or the minimum or maximum value? We can use the appropriate aggregation function. To show this, let's go back to our `ca_wac_2015` table. \n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT over100, COUNT(over100), AVG(c000) AS avg_jobs, MIN(c000), MAX(c000)\n",

    "    GROUP BY over100 \n",
    "    ORDER BY over100\n",
    "    LIMIT 1000;\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here, we're finding the counts, average, minimum, and maximum value of the total jobs in each census block within each group. Now, we're not doing anything very insightful here, since the groups already split the blocks by how many jobs there are. However, as we'll see later on, these aggregation functions can be very useful. For example, suppose we had the county data that's in `ca_xwalk` in this table. We could find the average number of jobs per census block for each county in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Side Note: Aliasing\n",
    "> You may have noticed that we included a part using \"`AS`,\" followed by a new name, in the first line. When you ran the code, you might have noticed that the column labels were changed to these new names. This is called aliasing, and is done for readability and ease of access. Later on, aliasing will also help us more easily reference tables within the same query.  "
